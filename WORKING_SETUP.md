# WhatsApp Clone - Working Setup Instructions

## 🎉 Your WhatsApp Clone is Ready!

Since you don't have MongoDB installed, I've created a **SQLite version** that works immediately without any database setup required!

## ✅ What's Working

✅ **SQLite Database** - No MongoDB required!  
✅ **User Registration & Login**  
✅ **Real-time Messaging**  
✅ **File & Image Sharing**  
✅ **Online Status & Typing Indicators**  
✅ **User Search**  
✅ **Modern WhatsApp-like UI**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start the Backend (SQLite Version)

Open a terminal in the backend folder:
```bash
cd backend
npm run sqlite
```

You should see:
```
Connected to SQLite database
Database synchronized
Server running on port 5001
Using SQLite database (whatsapp.db)
```

### 2. Start the Frontend

Open another terminal in the frontend folder:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📱 How to Test the App

1. **Register a new account** with any email and password
2. **Open another browser tab** (or incognito window) to register a second user
3. **Search for users** using the "Find Users" button
4. **Start chatting** - you'll see real-time messaging!
5. **Test file sharing** by clicking the 📎 button
6. **See typing indicators** when someone is typing

## 🔧 Configuration

- **Backend**: Runs on port 5001 (SQLite database)
- **Frontend**: Runs on port 3000
- **Database**: `whatsapp.db` file (automatically created)

## 📁 Database File

Your messages are stored in `backend/whatsapp.db`. This file contains all users and messages.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If you get "EADDRINUSE" error:
```bash
# Find the process using the port
netstat -ano | findstr :5001

# Kill the process (replace PID with actual number)
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F
```

### Frontend Can't Connect to Backend
Make sure:
1. Backend is running on port 5001
2. Frontend .env file has: `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api`

### Database Issues
Delete the `whatsapp.db` file and restart the backend - it will recreate the database.
